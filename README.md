# PopularMovies

## Project 1 and 2 for the [Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree--nd801)

**Project 1** consisted of building the core experience of the app. Fetching data from [theMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en) API, users are presented with a grid of movie posters to choose from, with the current most popular movies populated by default. Sort order can be changed by the user, selecting from most popular or highest rated. Selecting a movie by tapping a poster shows the movie details, including title, plot synopsis, user rating, and release date.

**Project 2** built upon Project 1, adding functionality to PopularMovies. Movie trailers and reviews were added to the details view, as well as the ability for the user to mark a selected movie as a "Favorite". Marking a movie as a "Favorite" added it to a list that the user could view in addition to the lists for current popular and highest rated movies. The app was also optimized for use on a tablet.
